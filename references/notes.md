## Key Learnings

### On Constraints
> "The enemy of art is the absence of limitations." — Orson Welles

Limited options force better decisions. A 6-value spacing scale beats a 12-value scale because there's less to think about.

### On Naming
Semantic names age better than appearance-based names:
- `intent.danger` vs `red.500`
- `text.primary` vs `gray.900`

When the palette changes, semantic names survive.

### On Accessibility
Build it in, don't bolt it on. Accessible components aren't a variant—they're the default.
